 *
 * This function destroys the existing Ethereum object and removes it from the window context,

 * and starts the onboarding process for MetaMask on desktop platforms.
 *
 * @param instance The MetaMaskInstaller instance used for debugging purposes.
 * @returns Promise<void> This function returns a promise that resolves to void.
