# Pure JavaScript SDK example
  **You must use a local HTTP server to serve index.html. Don't open the file `index.html` with a browser directly, otherwise the Metamast SDK will fail to detect Metamask extension**
  
  Here are the steps to run with node [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server).
  1. install nodejs
  2. start http-server 
     ```bash
     npx http-server
     ```
  3. visit your pure javascript demo in your browser, the default url is `http://127.0.0.1:8081`
