Get started by running:

```bash
# This repo expects you to use `nvm` (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for node version management.
# if that's not the case, make sure to ignore this bash command,
# and manually set your node to v20.19.0 or above.
nvm use
```

```bash
yarn install
```

and

```bash
yarn start connect
```
